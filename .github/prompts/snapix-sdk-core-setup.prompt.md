Set up **Snapix SDK Core** (`@metalevel/snapix-sdk-core`) in this project by following these steps exactly:

## Step 1 — Read the live documentation

Call `snapix_get_docs` with slug `sdk` to read the Snapix SDK Core integration guide.
Call `snapix_get_docs` with slug `mcp` to read the MCP setup reference.
Use both documents as the authoritative source for installation and configuration details.

## Step 2 — Install the package

Detect the package manager in use (check for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, or `package-lock.json`, in that order).
Install the package with the appropriate command:

- pnpm: `pnpm add @metalevel/snapix-sdk-core`
- yarn: `yarn add @metalevel/snapix-sdk-core`
- npm: `npm install @metalevel/snapix-sdk-core`

## Step 3 — Configure environment variables

Determine the correct `.env` file by checking in this priority order:
1. `.env.local` — use if it exists
2. `.env` — use if it exists
3. None found — create `.env.local`

**Append** the following lines to the chosen file. Do NOT overwrite or delete any existing content.
Leave values blank so the developer can fill them in:

```
# Snapix SDK Core — https://www.snapix.space/docs/sdk
SNAPIX_API_KEY=
SNAPIX_BASE_URL=
SNAPIX_BUCKET_KEY=
SNAPIX_LOG_LEVEL=
```

## Step 4 — Confirm

Report back which package manager was used, which `.env` file was modified (or created), and remind the developer to fill in `SNAPIX_API_KEY` — a free key can be obtained at https://www.snapix.space/user/api-keys.
